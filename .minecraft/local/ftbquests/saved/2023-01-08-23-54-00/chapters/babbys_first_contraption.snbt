Crushing wheels can be placed horizontally, and a pair of vertical gearboxes can help get them spinning against each other.\\n2. Add a container with a funnel to serve as an input buffer to the start of the belt. Add your ores here! The funnel won't extract more than the belt can handle, and items on the belt will stop while ores ahead of them get processed by the wheels.\\n3. Your ores should now be crushed! Next we can either wash them to get bonus resources, or smelt them as is.\\n\\nFor washing:\\n1. Place a depot after the crushing wheels, and put a block of water level with the depot. Use glass, trapdoors, etc. to contain it. Behind the liquid, place a fan, and make sure it is blowing out!\\n2. Place a container next in line with the depot, and attach a funnel (brass is better!). Then, using a filter, we can whitelist what items will be allowed in, or blacklist the crushed ores by tag.\\n3. Next, extract the nuggets into a basin with a mechanical press. Once nine nuggets make it in, it should compact them into an ingot. Extract and store as desired.\\n\\nFor smelting:\\n1.
